## 1.  What is VCS
***
**Version control** is a system that records all changes and modifications to files for tracking purposes. Developers also use the term source control or source code management. The primary goal of any version control system is to keep track of changes. It achieves this by allowing developers access to the entire change history with the ability to revert or roll back to a previous state or point in time.
